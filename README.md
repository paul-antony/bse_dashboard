# BSE Stock Price Dashboard

## Introduction

This project is a **BSE Stock Price Dashboard** built using **Flask** and **Splash**. The dashboard allows users to view stock prices of a selected list of stocks. The project uses **Splash**, a headless browser service, for web scraping, and **Flask** to serve dashboard. Both the flask webserver and splash browser runs in seperate docker containers. the project is designed in such a way so it can be hosted in [Render](https://render.com/)

You can test the live version of the dashboard here: [BSE Dashboard](https://bse-dashboard-4xrp.onrender.com).
